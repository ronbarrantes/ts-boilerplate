# TypeScript Boilerplate

This has a VERY basic boilerplate with a nice little package.json

## How to run

1. Install all the packages

```npm i```

2. Run the watcher

```npm run watch```

3. In a separate terminal, run the built file

```npm start```

There are also scripts to *clean* and *build* the project

## Notes

- Files will automatically lint on committing, you may bypass this by committing with the flag `--no-verify`
- Make sure you have a TypeScript linter extension such as [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin)
- Also [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) if you don't have it
